- This block allows you to easily travel upwards by placing blocks beneath your feet!
- To extend the Upblock, hit it with a pickaxe. It will teleport you upwards and place an extender block underneath you.
- To remove the Upblock and its extenders, use an axe. To remove an entire tower, hit the bottommost block with an axe. The blocks above it will be deleted.
- If you're standing on an Upblock tower, hit the topmost block with a sledgehammer to remove the tower and be teleported to the ground.
- Make sure there are at least five blocks of space above the Upblock, or else it won't extend.
